js-mask: Give Your JavaScript A Beautiful Mask So It Wouldn't Look Ugly
=======================================================================

A Vim plugin that makes your javascripts look more concise. The original intention is to make anonymous function less verbose and easier to understand at a glance. Requires Vim at least version 7.3.

Before:
    function Add(b, c) { return b + c; };
    setTimeout(function() { console.log("wooot") }, 10);

After:
    ùëì Add(b, c) { return b + c; };
    setTimeout(ùëì { console.log("wooot") }, 10);

That's it. Check https://github.com/tyok/js-mask for more docs.

Feel free to suggest additions and improvements via https://github.com/tyok/js-mask/issues. Or you can fork this from https://github.com/tyok/js-mask and add your own very personalized flavor.

Inspired by https://github.com/ehamberg/vim-cute-python which, in turn, is inspired by vimscript#3200.
